# Introduction
The weapon config allows for a modular configuration of the weapon used during an [experiment](experimentConfigReadme.md). Weapon configurations can either be [inlined](AnyFile.md#including-other-any-files) into the `experimentconfig.Any` or included as independent `.Any` file using the `#include("file.Any")` directive in the experiment configuration file to refer to a `[filename].weapon.Any` file (or any other `.Any` file including a weapon). If you plan to regularly change weapons we suggest using the later approach.

In the future support for a weapon editor might be offered as part of the application.

## File Location(s)
The [`data-files/weapon` directory](../data-files/weapon) contains some default weapon configurations as stand-alone `.Any` files. These file can be included using the supported `.Any` `#include` construct as shown below:

```
"weapon" : #include("[weapon file name].Any");
```

## Interaction with Experiment/Session Level Specification
The "parameter inheritance" structure used for experiment/session level parameters does not carry into the weapon configuration. That is to say, weapon configurations must be _completely_ specified wherever they are provided. For this reason we suggest encapsulating weapons in their own `*.weapon.Any` files and including them using a `#include()` directive.

As an example of this concept, you **cannot** (currently) specify a weapon at the experiment level, then change just one field within this weapon configuration on a per-session basis. Instead you need to _redefine_ this weapon for each session. Using `#include()` directives for weapons avoids this issue since the full weapon configuration is always specified.

# Weapon Config Field Descriptions

This file provides information about the weapon to be used in the experiment. Detailed field descriptions are provided below. Each example configuration provides the default values for it's fields.

| Parameter Name        |Units      | Description                                                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`maxAmmo`              |shots      | The maximum number of clicks a user can make in any given trial                                       |
|`firePeriod`           |s/shot     | The minimum fire period allowed in the session (set this to 0 if you want "laser" mode)               |
|`autoFire`             |`bool`     | Whether or not the weapon fires when the left mouse is held, or requires release between fire         |
|`damagePerSecond`      |damage/s   | The damage done by the weapon per second, when `firePeriod` > 0 the damage per round is set by `damagePerSecond`*`firePeriod`, when `firePeriod` is 0 and `autoFire` is `True` damage is computed based on time hitting the target.        |
|`hitScan`              |`bool`     | Whether or not the weapon acts as an instantaneous hitscan (true) vs propagated projectile (false)    |
|`fireSpreadDegrees`    |`float`    | The constant angular (horizontal and vertical) spread of bullets fired from the weapon in degrees. Clamps to 0 to 120 degrees. |
|`fireSpreadShape`      |`String`   | The distributional shape to draw the fire spread from (can be `"uniform"` or `"gaussian"`). Invalid fire types will result in no spread. When using a `"gaussian"` distribution shape `fireSpreadDegrees` is the width of the ±3σ interval. |

```
    "maxAmmo" : 10000;              // Large ammo count
    "firePeriod" : 0.5;             // 2 shots per second fire period
    "autoFire": false;              // Single fire (no hold to fire)
    "damagePerSecond": 2.0;         // 1 damage per shot (single shot to destroy)
    "hitScan" : true;               // Use hitscan (not propogated projectile) for hit detection
    "fireSpreadDegrees": 0;         // No fire spread by default
    "fireSpreadShape": "uniform";   // Uniform shape of fire spread distribution by default
```

Note that the `firePeriod` and `damagePerSecond` interact to create the amount of damage done per shot to the target. A target has 1.0 health, and will be eliminated once the damage is greater than or equal to that value. When deciding on these values, it's useful to set the `damagePerSecond` slightly higher than the pure multiple to avoid floating point error accumulating to require an additional shot. As an example, if you want 5 shots to kill a target over 1 second, you may be tempted to set the values to `firePeriod = 0.2` and `damagePerSecond = 1.0`, but it's possible that it will take 6 shots and 1.2 seconds to eliminate the target. By setting `damagePerSecond = 1.1`, it will ensure that the target will be killed in 5 shots over 1.0 seconds.

## Sound and View Model
Controls specific to the sound/view model for the weapon are provided below:

| Parameter Name        |Units      | Description                                                                                               |

```

## Decal Control
There are 2 types of weapon decals in FPSci, hit decals and miss decals. Hit decals are drawn on a target at the hit location, while miss decals are drawn to the scene at the point of a miss.

Currently FPSci supports only 1 hit decal being presented at a time, but a configurable amount (`missDecalCount`) of miss decals. Hit decals are removed after a timeout (`hitDecalTimeoutS`) or when a new hit decal is created (whichever happens first). Miss decals are removed based on one of three criteria:

- A new miss decal is created, bringing the total count of miss decals above `missDecalCount`, in this case oldest decal is removed
- The decal has existed for `missDecalTimeoutS`
- The current trial ends and `clearTrialMissDecals` is `true`, or the current session ends

Controls specific to the miss decals drawn in the scene are included below:

| Parameter Name        |Units      | Description                                                                                           |

```
"maxAmmo": 10000,           // Maximum ammo for the weapon
"firePeriod": 0.5,          // Fire twice a second max
"autoFire": false,          // Automatic firing if mouse is held
"damagePerSecond": 2.0,     // 2 damage/s * 0.5 s/shot = 1 damage/shot
"hitScan": false,

"fireSound": "sound/fpsci_fire_100ms.wav",       // The sound to fire
"fireSoundVol": 1.0f,
"fireSoundLoop": false,     // Don't loop fire audio  by default
"renderModel": true,        // Default is false,

	filename = "model/sniper/sniper.obj";
	preprocess = {
		transformGeometry(all(), Matrix4::yawDegrees(90));
		transformGeometry(all(), Matrix4::scale(1.2,1,0.4));
	};
	scale = 0.25;
},

"renderBullets": true,      // Default is false
"bulletSpeed": 100.0,       // Bullets move at 100m/s
"bulletGravity": 10.0,      // Bullets accelerate down at 10m/s²

"renderDecals": true,       // Draw decals on walls for misses/target for hit
"missDecal": "bullet-decal-256x256.png",           // Default miss decal
"missDecalCount": 2,        // Draw 2 decals (at most) at a time

"renderMuzzleFlash": false, // Draw a muzzle flash
"muzzleOffset": Vector3(0.0,-0.8,0.0)        // Add an offset here to correct the barrel location (default is [0,0,0])

"scopeFoV": 0.0,            // No scope
"scopeToggle": false,       // Scope in "on-demand" mode (not toggled)
```

Another example weapon for continuous firing follows below.

```
fireSound = "sound/fpsci_noise_50ms.wav";
fireSoundVol = 1.0f;
firePeriod = 0;
autoFire = true;
damagePerSecond = 2.0;
renderBullets = false;
renderDecals = false;
renderMuzzleFlash = false;
```
 
# Weapon Modes and Damage
There were several common "modes" that motivated the weapon configuration information provided in the experimentconfig. These are outlined below:

|  | autoFire = True | autoFire = False |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **firePeriod = 0** | "laser" mode | unlimited rate semi-auto |
| **firePeriod > 0** | limited rate full auto | limited rate semi-auto |

When using a non "laser" mode weapon, the damage done (per fired round) is computed as `damagePerSecond` * `firePeriod` where damage/s * s/fire = damage/fire.

When using a "laser" mode weapon the `damagePerSecond` is applied iteratively (the weapon does no damage instantaneously). Instead for each frame the laser stays over the target the health is reduced based on the time since the last frame.

# ArticulatedModel Specification
If you want to render a 3D model as the weapon from the FPS view you will need to provide a .Any serializable `ArticulatedModel` specification as the `modelSpec` field. The example below gives some info on how to do this.

    "modelSpec": ArticulatedModel::Specification{
        filename = "model/sniper/sniper.obj";
        preprocess = {
            transformGeometry(all(), Matrix4::yawDegrees(90));>
            transformGeometry(all(), Matrix4::scale(1.2,1,0.4));
            transformGeometry(all(), Matrix4::translation(0.5, 0, 0));
        };
        scale = 0.25;
    }

The `modelSpec` above provides a filename for a `.obj` file for the model, as well as several preprocess steps intended to orient, position, and scale the model correctly.

If the `renderModel` flag within a weapon configuration is `true` a `modelSpec` must be provided in the configuration. If a `modelSpec` is not provided an exception will be thrown at runtime stating this.
